        <p>
          I have been playing bass since I was 10 years old and since then it's given me some amazing opportunities from
          playing at Ronnie Scotts to collaborating with artists such as Rick Wakeman, Dave Holland and Dave Liebmann.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a classically trained Double Bass player, but also an experienced electric bass player covering genres
          from
          Jazz to Progressive Rock.
        </p>

        <p>
          Playing music has also led me down the path of audio editing and sound design. I've produced and mixed my own
          tracks and for local artists such as Cian Ducrot and Harry and The Chicks.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm a musican, have worked with various different musicians and now I'm looking to move into management and
          marketing within the music industry.
